vim-configs
===========

A collection of vim plugins bundled up all nice and pretty.

Basic Information
------------
This setup makes extensive use of the ['pathogen`](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) plugin from Tim Pope.
Additionally, it tries to use git submodules where appropriate so you always have the latest "vendor" plugin.

This set of plugins are hosted here ['vim_configs`](https://github.com/lusis/vim-configs)
